PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is a Food Menu web page for a restaurant. It showcases different categories of food items including Starters, Main Course, and Desserts. Each item has a description and a price. The menu items are displayed in a grid format, with images, names, descriptions, and prices for each food item.



FEATURES:

•	Responsive Layout: The page adjusts the grid to one column on smaller screens (e.g., mobile devices).

•	Interactive Hover Effect: Each menu item has a hover effect to make it more interactive and visually appealing.

•	Well-structured and Styled: The page uses CSS for layout and styling, with a clean design that focuses on the food items.
